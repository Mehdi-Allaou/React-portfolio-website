    I am a passionate frontend developer with lots of experience working with customer relations, design projects within construction and I also have a good eye for colors due to my many years of experience as a former painter. I am a person who is motivated by challenging work tasks and since I have always had the strive to work with problem solving and programming, my dream is to do it for a living - especially if it involves JavaScript and solving code challenges.
    I have ever since high school been drawn to computers and code. I managed to start the pursuit for my passion in the beginning of 2021, learning at first via courses on Udemy and Codecademy and later enrolling in a programming course by Lexicon. I'm glad that you are here so you can get to know me a little bit better and explore some of my projects, so don't miss checking them out!`;
